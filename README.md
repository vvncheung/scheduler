# Interview Scheduler

Interview Scheduler is a single page application, built using React. 

* The data is persisted by an API server using a PostGresSQL database
* The client application communicates with the API server over HTML, using the JSON format
* Jest tests are used throughout the development of the project, with the implementation of Cypress for end-to-end testing

## Project Features 

* The list of days informs the user how many slots are available for each day
* A user can switch between weekdays to see details for each day
* A user can book an interview in an empty appointment slot.
* A user can book an interview by typing in a student name and clicking on an interviewer from a list of available interviewers
* A user can cancel an existing interview
* A user can edit the details of an existing interview
* The expected day updates the number of spots available when an interview is booked or canceled
* A user is presented with a confirmation when they attempt to cancel an interview
* A user is shown an error if an interview cannot be saved or deleted
* A user is shown a status indicator while asynchronous operations are in progress
* When the user presses the close button of the error they are returned to the Form or Show view (skipping Status and Confirm)
* The application makes API requests to load and persist data. We do not lose data after a browser refresh
